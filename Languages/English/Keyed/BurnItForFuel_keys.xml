&lt;b>1.&lt;/b> Please reload your game for the changes to have full effect.
&lt;b>2.&lt;/b> Deselecting any resource normally used by a building (&lt;i>e.g.&lt;/i> wood logs for the campfire) will disable that building's fuel tab, and it will revert to using only their original fuel.
&lt;b>3.&lt;/b> The Pod Laucher and any other building that allows for fuel level adjustment are also excluded.
&lt;b>4.&lt;/b> Fuel units are always the same for any resource: 1 unit = 1 fuel.
